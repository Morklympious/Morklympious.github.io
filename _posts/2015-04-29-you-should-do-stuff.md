In my opinion, it's hard to know for sure when you're doing something right unless you know exactly what 'doing it right' looks like. In fact, I've been blogging on this site for about a year now, and I still have no idea if you guys are reading.

I have no idea if what I'm writing is rich in content or lessons.

I, additionally, have no idea on how to improve those contents or lessons! I don't have the feedback!

This isn't as crucial a problem as I'm leading you to believe. Blogging is fine. It can be inane, it can be silly, I choose to write to not only to cement my knowledge and think out loud, but also to give you a chuckle or fresh perspective along the way.

That said, the topic of this post is 'Do Stuff'.

A year and change ago, I was a jobless college grad. Unemployment wasn't without its perks, however. There's something seemingly magical about getting to bed at 5am and waking up at 1pm every day. The magic part being that a human being could actually waste that much sunshine and not feel bad about it.

I was sort of panicking. I didn't know what to do, and I just ended my tenure at The Digital Future Lab at UW Bothell as their sole web developer.

This is where the lesson is learned: In the short time that I had nothing to do, I found something (anything) to do. That's just it. When you're stuck in a rut, the best thing you can possibly do is stuff.

**Do stuff.**

Make something, explore something you don't know about. Build something. Learn a lesson! Just make sure that you're always active. For me, this meant working constantly on this website. I was doing something every day to make it better, and I want that for you!

Whatever your field is, I think it's important that you never stop learning or doing something that will make you better. There are a lot of articles I haven't published for Code and Comedy because I feel like they fell short of acceptable.

I'm happy I wrote them.

I'm happy I learned something enough to write about it.

There's an old Reddit post called ["No More Zero Days"](http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af) that apparently spawned its own subreddit, and that post has the exact same spirit that I'm talking about. No matter where you're at, never have a zero day, because you give up the second you stop trying.

I understand that you're thinking “Whoa Bradley, calm down, stop getting' all philosophical or whatever on me.”

I'm not! I'm just telling you that if you're stuck, UNSTICK YOURSELF AND LEARN SOMETHING NEW.

Read something, make something, learn something.

Something something something.

Always something.

Happy SOMETHING!
