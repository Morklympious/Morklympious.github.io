Hey. What's up. I bet you're wondering:

### Who is this clown?
Good question. Who am I? I don't even know. I'm some dude in his 20's that likes to make terrible puns, silly jokes, and, more pertinent to your visit here: websites.

I'm a web developer based in Redmond, where I spend my time skulking outside of Trader Joe's, waiting for the perfect deal to strike. I enjoy playing videogames and making music in my free time.

I enjoy blogging about my experiences with varying web technologies, or any processes, events, and other related things that I feel are not only awesome, but help me learn and grow as a web developer.
