### Who is this clown?
Good question. Who am I? I don't even know. I'm some dude in his 20's that likes to make terrible puns, silly jokes, and, more pertinent to your visit here: websites.

I'm a web developer based in Redmond, where I spend my time skulking outside of Trader Joe's, waiting for the perfect deal to strike. I enjoy playing videogames and making music in my free time.

Basically I'm one of the coolest developers you're ever going to meet. I'm hilarious, I spew inane thoughts on Twitter, and I'm dying to do something cool with web technologies. Let's get in touch!
