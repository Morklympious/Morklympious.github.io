Hey. What's up. I bet you're wondering:

### Who is this clown?
Good question. Who am I? I don't even know. I'm some dude in his 20's. 

Some dude that likes to make terrible puns.
The same dude that sings in a [comedy metal band](http://atlaschugged.bandcamp.com)

I enjoy coding, writing music, blogging, and playing games. 

I'm a web developer at Amazon, working on the AUI platform team that just so happens to vend reusable components to hundreds of internal teams as well as the Amazon Retail Website. I'm based in Redmond, where I spend my time skulking outside of Trader Joe's, waiting for the perfect deal to strike. I enjoy playing videogames and making music in my free time.

I enjoy blogging about my experiences with varying web technologies, or any processes, events, and other related things that I feel are not only awesome, but help me learn and grow as a web developer. I hope you learn something great here!
